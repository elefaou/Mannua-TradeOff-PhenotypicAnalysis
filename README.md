# Overview

The data and scripts provided here are supporting information to the manuscript "Hermaphroditic sex-allocation trade-offs and their genetic architecture revealed by experimental evolution" by Jörn F. Gerchen, Nora Villamil-Buenrostro, Xinji Li, Ehouarn Le Faou, and John R. Pannell from the Department of Ecology and Evolution of the University of Lausanne.

File descriptions:
- "DataImportation.R" : R script importing the data, loading the librairies and defining some useful variables used in the main script ("PhenotypicTradeOffAnalysis.R").
- "PhenotypicTradeOffAnalysis.R" : R script provinding the procedure followed for the two part of the phenotypic trade-off analysis.
- "LinearModellingWorkflow_supportFunctions.R" : R script containing some functions used in the main script ("PhenotypicTradeOffAnalysis.R").
- "Data/temporalDynamicsData.csv" : data for the temporal dynamic analysis of sexual phenotype evolution, from different populations and generations of the experiment of dissolution of dioecy by experimental evolution. The details of the variables is provided in the file "data/README.md".
- "Data/withinPopData.csv" : data for the within population phenotypic analysis, from population 5, generation 11 of the experiment of dissolution of dioecy by experimental evolution. The details of the variables is provided in the file "data/README.md".
- "Data/README.md" : details of the variables of the two .csv files containing the data ("Data/temporalDynamicsData.csv" and "Data/withinPopData.csv").
- "OutputFigures/temporalDynamicsFigure.jpg" : output figure of from the temporal dynamics data analysis.
- "OutputFigures/withinPopFigure.jpg" : output figure of from the within population data analysis.

# Authorship

The acquisition of data on the temporal dynamics where supervised by Nora Villamil-Buenrostro and Xinji Li, the data on within population phenotypes by Ehouarn Le Faou.
The scripts are by Ehouarn Le Faou, with the extensive use of a template for linear modelling produced by Matteo Santon, Fraenzi Korner-Nievergelt, Nico Michiels, Nils Anthes, and published at the DOI:10.3389/fevo.2023.1065273
